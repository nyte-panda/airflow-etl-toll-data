# ETL Toll Data Pipeline

This project contains an Apache Airflow DAG that performs a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on toll data stored in different formats.

## Included

- `dags/etl_toll_data_dag.py` — The main Airflow DAG file defining the ETL pipeline.
- `data/` — Folder containing input files:
  - `tolldata.tgz` — Compressed archive of raw input files.
  - `vehicle-data.csv`
  - `tollplaza-data.tsv`
  - `payment-data.txt`

## What the DAG Does

1. **Unzips** the compressed toll data archive.
2. **Extracts** relevant fields from:
   - A CSV file
   - A TSV file
   - A fixed-width TXT file
3. **Consolidates** all extracted data into a single file.
4. **Transforms** the vehicle type field to uppercase.

## Notes

- Output files are **generated by the DAG at runtime**.
- Only input files and the DAG script are included in this repository.
